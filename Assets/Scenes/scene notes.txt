the standard canvas size is going to be 80x60

if something isnt working check the player preffs at the top of tutorial manager and camera shutter script, 
set them to what they need to be (probably 0), play the scene then comment them out again.

do not go messing around in turorial manager or the explanation list in dialogue list

and i cant spell dialogue
