the table scenes going to be set in the gallery and may even be partt of the gallery scene like in the tutorial. 
the table scene should be scaled to be as small as can be with accurate shadows. the gallery scene is currently 
bigger than nessasary and its making lighting a bit more awquard so once the gallery layout is added to the table 
scene or vice versa the gallery scene will be scaled to fit.
